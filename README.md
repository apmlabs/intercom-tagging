Intercom Tagging: As most of you are aware that it’s impossible to search for the conversation in Intercom which doesn’t have a tag resulting in tedious manual steps. Therefore, we have created an application to find out all your Intercom conversations which are not tagged.

# Steps to follow:
1. Open the app: http://54.204.111.194/
2. Add your Dynatrace email address.
3. Apply some filters on the left sidebar
4. Submit the button to retrieve non tagged chats
5. Tag some chats and re-submit again to see the change

# Consider points:
# 1. Time saving:
Multiple steps are required to scroll through all your chats to check If It is tagged or un-tagged, so now you only have to focus on un-tagged chats rather than going through all your conversations.
# 2. Security:
The app is accessible only within the office network.

Lastly, I would like to collect thoughts and feedback on this to Improve it further so that we can have a quick call where I can explain technical aspects of the tool. In the meantime Happy Tagging guys
